# HumHub-ArtCom-Design
**[humhub-artcom-design] is a free Enter/Registration Page Design for the HumHub Content Management System (CMS).** 

Our Plans
---------

The design should only be a enterpage with working login and registration forms and with a small navigation for the imprint, privacy and the disclaimer pages.

Our design does have a responsive (html5 based) video background with a image fallback. It also got a H1, H2 and H3 for the logo and basic informations about Your community.

The rest of the whole design is based on the HumHub original design.

We would be happy if You contibute to the design and get it working. 
A lot of the project is already done.

Thank You for Your interest ;)
